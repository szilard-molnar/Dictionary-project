This project was built by a team of four students in the Full Stack Program. This project was built for users to have easy access to a dictionary, if the user did not want to open a book.
First, the user will enter a word from the Webster Section of dictionary and the meaning of that particular word will define the word.
Second, the user will enter a word from the Urban Dictionary, and the meaning of the word will define the urban way of the word that is spoken in everyday life. So, the meaning can be defined in street terms.
Third, everytime you enter a word the expression of that word will pop up in a giphy image. For example, if you type in happy, you will get a image of someone being happy or laughing.
